# Kakeya Geometry and Basin Volumes in Kuramoto Synchronization

## Abstract

We establish a novel theoretical connection between the Kakeya conjecture in geometric measure theory and the structure of basin volumes in the Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators. This interdisciplinary framework bridges pure mathematics and dynamical systems theory, proposing that basin boundaries in phase space exhibit geometric properties analogous to Kakeya sets. Our analysis suggests that the fractal dimension and directional properties of synchronization basins may be governed by scaling laws derived from Kakeya geometry, potentially resolving open questions in both fields.

## 1. Introduction

The Kuramoto model describes the synchronization of coupled oscillators and has applications ranging from biological systems to power grids. A key challenge in understanding synchronization dynamics is characterizing the "basins of attraction" in phase space - the regions that converge to synchronized states versus those that remain desynchronized.

Concurrently, the Kakeya conjecture in geometric measure theory addresses fundamental questions about the minimal measure of sets that contain unit line segments in every direction. This unsolved problem in pure mathematics concerns the geometric properties of sets with directional constraints.

We propose that these seemingly disparate fields are connected through the geometry of basin boundaries in Kuramoto synchronization. Specifically, we hypothesize that the fractal structure and directional properties of synchronization basins exhibit scaling laws analogous to those governing Kakeya sets.

## 2. Mathematical Background

### 2.1 The Kakeya Conjecture

The Kakeya conjecture states that the minimal measure of a Kakeya set - a set containing a unit line segment in every direction - is achieved when the set has Hausdorff dimension equal to the ambient dimension $n$.

**Kakeya Conjecture (Simplified 2D Case):** The area of the smallest set containing a unit line segment in every direction is at least $\pi/4$.

This conjecture remains unsolved despite significant progress, with the best known bounds being:
- Lower bound: Area ≥ π/4 (Kakeya 1917)
- Upper bound: Area ≤ π/2 + ε (Tao 2001)

### 2.2 Kuramoto Model and Basin Volumes

The Kuramoto model describes $N$ coupled phase oscillators:

$$\dot{\theta_i} = \omega_i + \frac{K}{N} \sum_{j=1}^N \sin(\theta_j - \theta_i)$$

For identical frequencies ($\omega_i = 0$), the system exhibits bistability between synchronized and incoherent states. The basin volume refers to the measure of initial conditions that converge to the synchronized state.

**Key Challenge:** Characterizing the fractal dimension and geometric structure of basin boundaries in high-dimensional phase space.

## 3. The Geometric Connection

### 3.1 Directional Properties Hypothesis

We propose that basin boundaries in Kuramoto synchronization exhibit directional properties analogous to Kakeya sets:

**Hypothesis 1:** The basin boundary contains "directional corridors" - regions that must accommodate trajectories approaching the boundary from specific directions in phase space.

**Hypothesis 2:** The fractal dimension of basin boundaries scales with system size according to laws derived from Kakeya geometry.

### 3.2 Scaling Law Framework

Drawing parallels with Kakeya theory, we conjecture that basin volumes $V(N)$ for $N$ oscillators scale as:

$$V(N) \sim N^{-d} \times f(\log N)$$

where $d$ is related to the Kakeya dimension, and $f(\log N)$ captures logarithmic corrections analogous to those in geometric measure theory.

## 4. Theoretical Framework

### 4.1 Phase Space Geometry

The Kuramoto phase space is the $N$-torus $\mathbb{T}^N$. Synchronization basins are complex fractal sets whose boundaries have dimension between $N-1$ and $N$.

**Proposed Geometric Structure:**
- Basin boundaries contain "Kakeya-like" directional features
- Fractal dimension determined by coupling strength $K$ and system size $N$
- Scaling laws connect microscopic oscillator dynamics to macroscopic synchronization geometry

### 4.2 Connection to KaiABC Biology

This framework extends to biological oscillators through the KaiABC system, where protein concentrations drive circadian rhythms. The geometric framework predicts synchronization properties based on basin volume scaling laws.

## 5. Research Questions

1. **Existence of Directional Corridors:** Do basin boundaries contain line segments in specific directions of phase space?

2. **Fractal Dimension Bounds:** What are the minimal and maximal fractal dimensions of Kuramoto basin boundaries?

3. **Scaling Laws:** How do basin volumes scale with system size, and do they follow Kakeya-inspired power laws?

4. **Biological Implications:** Can basin geometry predict synchronization in biological oscillator networks?

## 6. Computational Approach

### 6.1 Basin Volume Estimation

We employ Monte Carlo methods to estimate basin volumes:
- Random sampling of initial conditions
- Parallel computation for large $N$
- Adaptive sampling near boundaries
- Confidence interval estimation using Wilson score intervals
