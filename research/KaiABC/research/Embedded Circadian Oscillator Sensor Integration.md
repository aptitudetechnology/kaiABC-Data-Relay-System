## **I. Foundational Systems Modeling: The Minimal KaiABC Engine**

The construction of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) software implementation of the cyanobacterial KaiABC circadian clock system, intended for real-time operation on a constrained embedded platform, requires a meticulous balance between biochemical fidelity and computational efficiency. This foundational section addresses the selection and mathematical formalization of the core oscillator model, which dictates the performance envelope of the entire system.

### **I.1 Selection of the Minimal KaiABC Kinetic Model**

#### **Necessity of Dimensionality Reduction**

The complete mechanistic understanding of the KaiABC clock involves the dynamic phosphorylation and structural transitions of KaiC hexamers, leading to the cyclic sequestration of the KaiA activator protein.1 Detailed molecular models tracking all unique phosphorylation states, complex formations, and monomer exchange processes often require the solution of several hundred coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).3 Such high-dimensional systems are computationally prohibitive for real-time integration on microcontrollers (MCUs) such as the Raspberry Pi Pico or ELM11, where memory and floating-point processing speed are limited.4

#### **Adoption of Simplified ODE Framework**

To achieve computational tractability for the MVP, the approach mandates the use of a simplified, low-dimensional ODE framework derived from established models, such as those presented by van Zon, Rust, or subsequent research groups.1 These simplified models capture the essential biochemical feedback loop:

1. KaiA catalyzes the phosphorylation of KaiC (specifically at sites S431 and T432).  
2. Phosphorylated KaiC (particularly the ST and S forms) acts as a scaffold for KaiB binding.  
3. The resulting inhibitory KaiA•KaiB•KaiC complexes (CABC​) sequester free KaiA (Afree​).1  
4. Depletion of Afree​ causes the net phosphorylation rate to drop, allowing the intrinsic phosphatase activity of KaiC to dominate, thus cycling the system back toward the unphosphorylated state.2

This simplified mass action ODE formulation, typically tracking 5 to 10 key species, preserves the necessary non-linear dynamics (a stable limit cycle) while minimizing the computational burden. Selecting a model that maintains this core feedback loop is necessary to ensure the MVP can accurately track the temporal progression of the biological clock, even if it sacrifices some of the microscopic detail regarding synchronization dynamics (which often require explicit monomer exchange or single-molecule modeling approaches).3 For the primary goal of tracking phase and enabling entrainment, the simplified model is sufficient.

### **I.2 Mathematical Formulation of the Core Oscillator**

The dynamics of the system are defined by coupled ODEs based on mass action kinetics. The system implicitly includes the requirement that the oscillation is driven by continuous energy input, which models the steady ATP hydrolysis necessary for sustained oscillation and synchronization in the biological system.5

#### **State Variables and Mass Action Kinetics**

The required minimal model must track the concentrations of essential protein species. The key state variables, their roles, and their relevance to the entrainment mechanism are summarized in the following table.  
Table 1: Core State Variables and Key Reactions for MVP KaiABC ODE System

| State Variable | Symbol | Biological Role | Relationship to Entrainment (T-Modulation) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Unphosphorylated KaiC | CU​ | Substrate for KaiA/Phosphorylation | Input for kP,i​ rates (Arrhenius dependent) |
| Doubly Phosphorylated KaiC | CST​ | Peak state; regulates complex formation | Critical output state (KOA); drives KaiB binding 1 |
| Sequestration Complex | CABC​ | Inhibits clock by binding KaiA | Formation rate is temperature and structure-coupling (di​) sensitive 6 |
| Free KaiA | Afree​ | Kinase/Activator; level dictates rate | Level is dictated by sequestration complex activity 1 |
| Total KaiC (Constant) | Ctotal​ | Constraint: ∑Ci​=Ctotal​ | Defines the concentration ceiling for all states |

The governing equations take the general form of coupled ODEs describing the rate of change for each species X:

dtd\[X\]​=∑Production Rates−∑Consumption Rates

These rates are determined by rate constants (ki​) and the concentrations of reactants raised to their stoichiometric powers (mass action kinetics).1 For example, the rate of depletion of free KaiA depends fundamentally on the rate of  
CABC​ complex formation, which is driven by the specific KaiC phosphostates like CST​.1 The temporal relationships among the species are critical: the peak of  
CABC​ formation lags the peak of CST​ by 6–8 hours.1

#### **Requirement for Temperature Compensation Parameters**

A core objective of this project is environmental entrainment. For the modulation strategies discussed in Section III to succeed, the mathematical model must retain parameters that govern the biological mechanism of temperature compensation. If the model only contains simple mass action ki​ rates, it may simulate the oscillation, but it will fail to accurately model the temperature robustness—or more importantly, the specific mechanism that allows entrainment to override that robustness.  
Therefore, the chosen ODE system must explicitly link temperature (T) not only to standard phosphorylation/dephosphorylation rates (ki​) via the Arrhenius equation 7 but also to specific internal factors, such as the parameters (  
di​) controlling the structural feedback and complex formation or the factors related to the ATPase activity.6 Without these compensatory mechanisms encoded, the primary entrainment function of the MVP will be biologically irrelevant.

### **I.3 Baseline Parameters and Periodicity**

To establish a stable oscillation, the system must be parameterized for nominal conditions. The reference temperature is set at T0​=298.15 K (25∘ C).2 At this temperature, the initial concentrations of the total proteins (  
Atotal​,Btotal​,Ctotal​) must be set within the narrow range known to support sustained, stable limit cycles, typically resulting in a period of approximately 24 hours.2  
The baseline rate constants ki​(T0​) define the system's kinetic profile at the reference temperature. For all phosphorylation and dephosphorylation steps, the temperature dependence must be defined by the Arrhenius equation:

ki​(T)=Ai​exp(−RTEi​​)

where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, Ai​ is the pre-exponential factor, and Ei​ is the activation energy.7 Baseline activation energy values used in modeling the KaiABC system typically range from 25 to  
43 kJ/mol for various steps.7 These values establish the standard, temperature-dependent acceleration of the chemical reactions, which the structural coupling mechanism must then counteract to achieve compensation.

## **II. Hardware and Software Architecture for Real-Time Simulation**

The architecture must provide the necessary computational capacity to execute the stiff, non-linear ODE system in real time while interfacing with environmental sensors.

### **II.1 MVP Hardware Platform Selection and Justification (Raspberry Pi Pico / ELM11)**

#### **Processor Requirements and Floating-Point Arithmetic**

Numerical integration of chemical kinetic ODEs relies heavily on floating-point arithmetic. Comparative benchmarks demonstrate that 8-bit microcontrollers, such as the Arduino Uno/Nano, are severely performance-limited, achieving only approximately 1300 integration steps per second using single precision.4 This performance profile makes them unsuitable for real-time simulation of complex, stiff biological systems.  
The selection of the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) or ELM11 boards provides the required computational capacity for the client-server architecture. While these devices lack hardware floating-point units, the client-server model offloads intensive ODE computation to a central server, allowing the embedded devices to focus on efficient sensor reading and local PWM control. The system must aim to achieve network communication latencies low enough to ensure that the entire entrainment loop, including sensor reading, data transmission, server processing, and command reception, completes within the stringent real-time constraint of less than 100 ms per iteration.4

#### **Memory and Interface Capacity**

The system requires adequate memory to host the MicroPython (Pico) or Lua (ELM11) runtime, sensor data buffering, and local PWM control logic. The Raspberry Pi Pico provides 264KB SRAM and 2MB Flash, while ELM11 boards typically offer 128-512KB SRAM depending on the model. These capacities are sufficient for the lightweight client role, with the server handling all heavy computation and data storage.  
For environmental sensing, the BME280 or DHT22 sensors are easily integrated. The BME280, providing temperature (T), humidity (H), and pressure (P), communicates via the standard I²C protocol, which is natively supported by MicroPython's machine library and Lua sensor libraries, simplifying the hardware abstraction layer.11

### **II.2 Numerical Integration Strategy for Constrained Environments**

#### **Stiffness and the Need for Adaptive Solvers**

The KaiABC model exhibits "stiffness," a numerical property where different molecular reactions operate on widely disparate timescales. Stiffness presents a significant challenge to fixed-step numerical solvers (like standard Runge-Kutta 4), often requiring an impractically small time step (Δt) to maintain stability, leading to excessively long computation times.4  
For an MVP functioning under real-time constraints, an adaptive numerical integration strategy is mathematically essential. We mandate the selection of a low-order adaptive solver, such as the Runge-Kutta Fehlberg methods (e.g., RKF32 or RKF45). The power of the RKF scheme lies in its use of an embedded error estimation technique. This technique allows the solver to dynamically adjust the time step (Δt) based on the local error tolerance. During slow phases of the cycle (e.g., the prolonged KaiA sequestration phase), the solver can take large steps, maximizing efficiency. During rapidly changing, stiff phases (e.g., the onset of phosphorylation), the solver automatically reduces Δt, guaranteeing stability and accuracy without sacrificing overall speed.12  
The fundamental necessity of using an adaptive solver arises from the requirement for stability in simulating a stable limit cycle oscillator. The computational overhead associated with the error estimation is entirely justified by the stability enhancement and the ability to use a larger average time step, which is vital for achieving the target real-time processing speed.4

#### **Optimization for Performance**

While MicroPython (Pico) and Lua (ELM11) offer productive scripting environments for the client-side logic, the time-critical component—the right-hand side function defining the coupled ODEs (  
dtd\[X\]​) and the core adaptive solver algorithm—must be optimized for execution speed on the server. It is advisable for the server-side solver core to be implemented in an optimized, compiled language (such as C or C++) and tightly integrated with the server runtime (potentially via wrappers, similar to how goss wraps C++ libraries for Python desktop environments).12 This server-side optimization is required to ensure the system consistently meets the sub-  
100 ms processing window necessary for real-time operation.

### **II.3 Software Stack Design (Client-Server Focus)**

The architecture is layered to maintain modularity and optimize performance across the client-server model:

1. **Client Hardware Abstraction Layer:** This foundation comprises the MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico) or Lua (ELM11) runtime on the embedded devices, utilizing the respective machine libraries for direct interaction with I²C/GPIO pins, and the time module for precise scheduling and loop timing.9  
2. **Client Sensor Layer:** This layer handles raw data acquisition from the BME280 and implements basic local filtering and buffering for transmission to the server.  
3. **Network Communication Layer:** Lightweight HTTP/REST or MQTT protocols for sensor data transmission and command reception, with automatic fallback to local PWM control during network outages.  
4. **Server Kinetic Core Layer:** This is the compiled, high-speed ODE solver running on the server. It receives dynamically updated kinetic parameters (ki′​) from the Entrainment Module and performs the numerical integration to advance the state variables (concentrations) of the oscillator system.  
5. **Server Entrainment Module Layer:** This module processes the smoothed temperature input from multiple clients, calculates the current phase of each oscillator, and applies the Entrainment Transfer Functions (ETFs) to generate the new, modulated kinetic parameters (ki′​).  
6. **Server Output Translation Layer:** This final layer translates the internal biochemical state (specifically the concentration profiles of phosphorylated KaiC species) into the external, actionable signal commands sent back to clients for PWM control (Section IV).

## **III. Dynamic Environmental Entrainment and Modulation Kinetics**

Achieving functional entrainment requires a systematic approach to conditioning sensor data and mapping it, via sophisticated transfer functions, onto the kinetic parameters of the ODE model in a biologically relevant manner.

## **III. Dynamic Environmental Entrainment and Modulation Kinetics**

Achieving functional entrainment requires a systematic approach to conditioning sensor data and mapping it, via sophisticated transfer functions, onto the kinetic parameters of the ODE model in a biologically relevant manner.

### **III.1 Sensor Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**

The BME280 sensor provides real-time streams of Temperature (T), Humidity (H), and Pressure (P).11 While  
T is the primary entraining signal for the KaiABC clock, H and P can be maintained as secondary inputs for future redox or microclimate sensing integrations.

#### **Signal Noise Mitigation via Kalman Filtering**

A critical vulnerability in real-time simulation is the introduction of noise. Feeding raw, noisy sensor data directly into a highly non-linear, stiff ODE system guarantees numerical instability and potential divergence.7 Consequently, the MVP requires robust digital filtering.  
The system mandates the implementation of a Kalman filter (specifically, an Extended or Unscented Kalman filter, given the non-linear relationship between the raw measurement data and the estimated ODE parameters).8 The filter functions to estimate the true underlying environmental state, providing a stable, smoothed temperature input (  
T^). The filter accomplishes this by integrating successive noisy measurements over time, using dynamic modeling to improve the accuracy of the prediction and stabilize the input to the Entrainment Transfer Functions (ETFs).8 This online, real-time filtering process prevents sudden, spurious fluctuations in the kinetic parameters  
ki′​ that would destabilize the simulated limit cycle.

### **III.2 Modeling Temperature Compensation and Entrainment**

The cyanobacterial clock is renowned for its temperature compensation, characterized by a Q10 value near 1.06, meaning its period remains stable across a wide physiological temperature range.7 This inherent stability presents the core challenge for entrainment. Simply increasing all  
ki​ rates via generic Arrhenius scaling proportional to temperature will not significantly alter the period, as the wild-type system is designed to correct for this acceleration.  
The established hypothesis for compensation posits a balance between two opposing temperature effects 6:

1. **Acceleration of Chemical Rates:** Standard chemical reactions (like phosphorylation/dephosphorylation) have positive activation energies (Ei​) and accelerate exponentially with increasing T (Arrhenius scaling).7 This effect alone would shorten the period.  
2. **Attenuation of Structural Coupling:** Increased thermal fluctuations at higher temperatures weaken the necessary reaction-structure feedback coupling. Specifically, the interactions governing the association of KaiB and KaiC, crucial for sequestering KaiA, are attenuated. This reduction in coupling strength effectively enlarges the period, precisely counteracting the acceleration of the chemical rates.6

Therefore, to achieve *active entrainment*—that is, forcing the clock to shift its phase or period beyond its native robustness—the environmental input must intentionally modulate the system in a way that breaks or overshoots this natural compensation balance.6 This requires designing specific Entrainment Transfer Functions (ETFs) that target the compensation mechanisms themselves.

### **III.3 Defining the Entrainment Transfer Functions (ETFs)**

The ETFs map the filtered environmental input (T^) to the specific kinetic parameters (ki′​) targeted for modulation. The system must accommodate a framework that simulates a biologically *sensitized* oscillator, meaning it behaves like a mutant whose compensation mechanism is slightly flawed or highly tunable.

#### **ETF 1: Baseline Arrhenius Scaling**

All primary phosphorylation/dephosphorylation rate constants (ki,P​) are subject to standard thermal scaling based on the Arrhenius law 7:  
ki′​(T)=ki​(T0​)⋅eREi​​⋅(T0​1​−T1​)

This function establishes the baseline acceleration that the system must then compensate for, or, in the case of entrainment, fail to compensate for completely.

#### **ETF 2: Modulating Structural Coupling**

Targeting the parameters that govern the structure-reaction feedback coupling (di​) is the most direct way to bypass compensation.6 These parameters control the strength of interaction at the KaiC CI-CII interface, influencing KaiB binding and subsequent KaiA sequestration.6 The modified coupling strength  
di′​(T) is defined by a non-linear function s(T^):

di′​(T)=di​(T0​)⋅s(T^)

If s(T^) is tuned to attenuate the coupling less than the native mechanism would require at higher T, the period will shorten (advance). Conversely, if s(T^) causes greater attenuation than necessary, the period will lengthen (delay). The success of the entrainment strategy relies entirely on calibrating this non-linear function s(T^) to elicit predictable phase shifts (ΔΦ) across the relevant temperature range.

#### **ETF 3: Violating the ATPase Constraint**

An alternative method for introducing period dependence is by modulating the ATPase reactions in the CI domain of KaiC.6 In the wild-type, temperature compensation is maintained because the product of the inverse lifetime of the ADP bound state (  
ΔADP​) and the hydrolysis frequency (fhyd​) is kept constant (ΔADP​⋅fhyd​=const).6  
To achieve forced period modulation (entrainment), the model must simulate a mechanism that violates this constraint, effectively modeling a Case II mutant.6 By allowing the function  
fhyd​ to become significantly temperature-dependent through a non-compensatory scaling function g(T^), a clear correlation is created between the environmental input (T^) and the oscillation frequency.

fhyd′​(T)=fhyd​(T0​)⋅g(T^)

This approach ensures that the simulated clock is inherently sensitive to thermal shifts, allowing external inputs to effectively drive frequency modulation.  
Table 2: Critical Entrainment Transfer Functions (ETFs) for Temperature Modulation

| Target Parameter/Factor | Baseline Rule (Compensation) | Modulation Mechanism (Entrainment Strategy) | Mathematical Function Template |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Phosphorylation Rates (kP,i​) | Arrhenius scaling, Ei​≈40 kJ/mol 7 | Standard T-scaling | ki′​=ki​(T0​)⋅eREi​​⋅(T0​1​−T1​) |
| Structure Coupling Strength (di​) | Attenuated by T to compensate kP,i​ 6 | Modulate attenuation function s(T) to intentionally amplify or diminish compensation | di′​=di​(T0​)⋅s(T^), where s is non-linear and tuned to ΔΦ |
| ATPase Constraint (ΔADP​⋅fhyd​) | Constant (Temperature Insensitive) 6 | Violate constraint (simulate Case II mutant) by allowing T to modulate fhyd​ | fhyd′​(T)=fhyd​(T0​)⋅g(T^), where g introduces period dependence |

### **III.4 Application of Phase Response Curves (PRCs)**

The ultimate goal of entrainment is to synchronize the internal clock phase (Φ) to an external cue, often requiring phase resets. The necessary logic for this closed-loop control relies on pre-determined Phase Response Curves (PRCs).

#### **PRC Integration and Phase Tracking**

The system must continuously track the current phase Φ based on the relative concentrations of the simulated protein species. The current Circadian Time (CT) is typically determined by the oscillation profile of the KaiC phosphostates. For instance, peak CST​ and the onset of CABC​ complex formation occur late in the cycle (near CT 16-22).1  
The PRC is a map that correlates the timing of an external stimulus (a temperature step ΔT) with the magnitude and direction of the resulting phase shift (ΔΦ). Research has shown that applying a temperature step-up (ΔT\>0) between CT 16 and CT 22 induces a phase advance, whereas a step-down during the same time window induces a phase delay.14

#### **Closed-Loop Entrainment Logic**

The entrainment algorithm executes a closed-loop control sequence:

1. **Sensing and Filtering:** Sensor measures T→ Kalman filter outputs T^.  
2. **Modulation:** T^ is applied to the ETFs to yield ki′​.  
3. **Integration:** The ODE solver updates the state variables, determining the current phase Φ.  
4. **Phase Logic:** If synchronization is required, the current Φ is compared against the target phase. The required corrective temperature step (ΔT) is determined using the PRC map.  
5. **Actuation:** The system simulates the application of ΔT by adjusting the inputs to the ETF, effectively implementing the intended phase advance or delay.

This dynamic system ensures that the phase of the simulated clock can be accurately managed and locked to an external environmental rhythm, fulfilling the core MVP requirement.

## **IV. Practical Applications and Output Layer Design**

The utility of the software oscillator is realized through its ability to translate the highly structured temporal information encoded in the ODE state variables into practical, actionable output signals.

### **IV.1 Mapping Simulated State to Actionable Output (KOA Metric)**

#### **Biological Output Pathway**

In cyanobacteria, the KaiABC oscillator communicates temporal information to the gene expression machinery via phosphotransfer relays involving sensor histidine kinases (SasA and CikA) and the response regulator RpaA.13 The timing of transcription is tightly correlated with specific KaiC phosphostates. Specifically, the transition to the singly phosphorylated S-KaiC state, which follows the peak of  
CST​, regulates the formation of the output complex that promotes genome-wide circadian responses.1

#### **Defining Kai-Complex Output Activity (KOA)**

For the MVP, a quantifiable metric is required to represent this regulatory output. We define the Kai-complex Output Activity (KOA) as a metric correlated with the prevalence of the signaling-competent KaiC phosphostates.13  
KOA∝f(,,)

Based on biological experiments, the KOA is designed to peak late in the circadian cycle, coinciding with the subjective dawn, when CST​ or CS​ reaches maximum prevalence.1 By monitoring the dynamic profile of these specific simulated state variables, the KOA provides a continuously varying signal that drives the practical application.  
The fidelity of this output relies on acknowledging the inherent asymmetry of the biological clock.2 The KaiC proteins typically spend less time in the phosphorylation phase compared to the dephosphorylation phase, resulting in an asymmetric rhythm. Mapping the output directly to the dynamically calculated KOA ensures that the resulting control signal retains this biologically relevant temporal asymmetry, which is vital for mimicking genuine biological timing.

### **IV.2 MVP Output Interface and Demonstrator**

The MVP requires a simple, controllable physical interface to demonstrate its functionality as a timekeeper.

#### **Interface Specification**

The calculated KOA value will be mapped to a hardware interface, such as a Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal, suitable for driving a high-power LED (mimicking a phased light source) or a peristaltic dosing pump (mimicking controlled nutrient flow in a bioreactor).

* **Low KOA (Subjective Midnight):** The PWM duty cycle is minimal, representing the trough of expression or activity.  
* **Peak KOA (Subjective Dawn):** The PWM duty cycle is maximum, representing peak transcription or activity.13

This output serves as a verifiable demonstrator, proving that the internal, high-speed ODE simulation is successfully translating temporal biochemical information into a macro-level, phase-locked control signal.

### **IV.3 Robustness, Stability, and Failure Modes**

Operating a complex, floating-point intensive ODE solver on bare-metal embedded hardware necessitates robust failure mitigation strategies to ensure real-time stability.

#### **Numerical Stability Monitoring**

The use of the adaptive Runge-Kutta Fehlberg solver provides an inherent mechanism for stability monitoring, as it continuously calculates the local integration error. The MVP code must leverage this error estimate. If the calculated error exceeds a pre-defined tolerance threshold, the execution logic should automatically abort the current integration step and re-attempt the calculation with a smaller time step (Δt). This process prevents numerical runaway, instability, and phase drift caused by integrating through exceptionally stiff regions of the phase space.

#### **Watchdog Timers and State Initialization**

For critical real-time systems, a hardware watchdog timer is indispensable. If the entire integration loop (including sensor reading, filtering, and ODE solving) exceeds a hard timeout (e.g., 500 ms), indicating a computational stall or floating-point exception, the watchdog timer must automatically reset the MCU.  
Furthermore, state variable integrity must be maintained. The implementation must include logic to check if state variable concentrations (e.g., \[CU​\], \[Afree​\]) drift outside physically realistic bounds (such as becoming negative due to numerical error). Should this occur, the system must trigger a state reset, re-initializing all variables to known stable concentrations and restarting the oscillation from the nominal conditions.  
Table 3: MVP Embedded System Performance Targets and Constraints

| Component/Metric | Constraint Requirement | Justification/Implementation Note |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

| **Server Memory** | ≥4 GB RAM | For ODE state history, Kalman filter matrices, and multi-client coordination. |
| **Entrainment Resolution** | Phase shift ΔΦ≤1 hour per temperature step | Defines the required sensitivity of the Entrainment Transfer Function (ETF) and numerical precision.14 |

## **V. Synthesis and Future Development Trajectories**

### **V.1 Summary of MVP Performance Metrics**

The successful deployment of the MVP must be validated against several rigorous performance metrics, demonstrating that the design choices made for computational efficiency and biological fidelity were effective:

1. **Period Accuracy:** The system must demonstrate maintenance of a period oscillating consistently around 24 hours (e.g., 23.5 h to 24.5 h) under nominal temperature conditions (T0​) and stability in concentrations.  
2. **Entrainment Range and Fidelity:** The clock must maintain stable, non-damped oscillations within an environmentally induced range of at least ±5∘ C from T0​, specifically demonstrating that the period or phase shift is controllable via the designed kinetic parameter modulation (ETFs).  
3. **Phase Reset Capability:** The closed-loop control must successfully execute a defined phase advance and delay, where the magnitude of the shift (ΔΦ) matches predictions derived from the pre-simulated Phase Response Curve.14  
4. **Computational Efficiency:** The average time step calculation speed must be benchmarked and maintained above the required threshold (e.g., \>7000 steps/second), with the peak iteration time consistently remaining below the 100 ms real-time constraint.4

### **V.2 Scalability and Future Enhancements**

The current MVP focuses solely on thermal entrainment. However, biological clocks are inherently multimodal, integrating cues from light, redox state, and nutritional status. The architecture must be scalable to incorporate a full spectrum of environmental synchronization signals.

#### **Incorporation of Redox Signaling**

A critical enhancement involves integrating environmental sensors that act as proxies for the redox state of the cell (e.g., Electrochemical O₂ sensors). The biological mechanism utilizes the LdpA protein, which contains redox-active iron-sulfur clusters, to sense the cellular redox state.16 LdpA is known to interact with the clock proteins, specifically modulating the abundance and sensitivity of CikA and KaiA.16  
This suggests a future expansion where the measured environmental oxygen level is mapped, via a new, modular ETF, onto the kinetic parameters that govern KaiA or CikA dynamics, providing a non-thermal entrainment pathway. This integration moves the system toward a more comprehensive, bio-inspired timing device, acknowledging that biological entrainment is rarely governed by a single cue.16

#### **Multi-Node Coordination and Server Optimization**

The client-server architecture enables coordination across multiple Raspberry Pi Pico and ELM11 nodes. For high-performance server requirements, the system should be optimized by dedicating specific computational loads to server resources. The server would be reserved exclusively for the time-critical, floating-point intensive tasks—namely, the C/C++ ODE integration core and the Kalman filter routines—ensuring minimal latency and maximum speed. Client devices handle the non-time-critical operations, such as sensor polling, network communication, and local PWM control. This distribution is necessary to maintain real-time performance as the complexity of the ODE model or the number of sensor inputs increases.  
The modular architecture of the Entrainment Transfer Functions (ETFs) is designed precisely to accommodate this expansion. New environmental inputs, whether light (lux sensor data mapped to CikA/LdpA stability) or redox state (O₂ sensor), can be seamlessly integrated into the existing control loop by defining new, independent ETFs that map these non-thermal inputs to different sets of biologically relevant kinetic parameters (ki​).15

## **Conclusions and Recommendations**

The proposed MVP architecture successfully addresses the challenge of creating a real-time, entrainable biological oscillator simulation using a distributed client-server model with Raspberry Pi Pico and ELM11 embedded devices. The system leverages essential compromises: selecting a simplified, low-dimensional ODE model to ensure computational viability on the server, while simultaneously retaining the specific kinetic parameters necessary to model and intentionally override the mechanism of temperature compensation.  
The selection of the Raspberry Pi Pico (MicroPython) and ELM11 (Lua) platforms for client devices, combined with server-side ODE computation, provides the required computational capacity for high-speed floating-point stability in a stiff, non-linear system. The implementation of a Kalman filter on the server is paramount for maintaining system stability by mitigating environmental sensor noise before inputting the data into the highly sensitive kinetic model.  
The critical functional design element is the set of Entrainment Transfer Functions (ETFs), which transform stable temperature compensation into tunable entrainment sensitivity. This is achieved by modeling the system as a sensitized mutant that intentionally violates the biological constraints governing stability, allowing the external temperature signal to directly correlate with the oscillation frequency and phase.  
It is recommended that development focus initially on the rigorous calibration of the non-linear transfer functions s(T^) and g(T^) (ETF 2 and 3\) to accurately reproduce the expected Phase Response Curves (PRCs). Subsequent development should prioritize the expansion of the MVP to include a modular redox-sensing ETF pathway, providing the multi-input entrainment capability necessary for achieving full biological fidelity and relevance in applied synchronization technologies.
