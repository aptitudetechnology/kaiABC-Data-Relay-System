# Web Demo Enhancements - October 7, 2025

## Overview
Added 5 major enhancements to `webdemo/kakeya.html` based on the expanded research in `deep-research-prompt-claude.md`.

---

## Enhancement #1: Enhanced σ_ω Calculation Display ✅

### What Was Added:
- **Heterogeneity Percentage**: Shows σ_ω/⟨ω⟩ as a percentage
- **Color-Coded Badge**: Visual indicator of compensation quality
  - Green "Excellent" (<10%)
  - Yellow "Good" (10-30%)
  - Red "Challenging" (>30%)
- **Dynamic Background Colors**: Container changes color based on quality
- **Interpretation Text**: Plain-language explanation of what the numbers mean

### Location:
Environmental Factors section, below the Q10 and temperature sliders

### User Value:
Users can instantly see if their Q10 choice leads to good or poor synchronization conditions, with clear visual feedback.

---

## Enhancement #2: Basin of Attraction Volume Predictor ✅

### What Was Added:
- **Visual Progress Bar**: Shows basin volume as percentage (0-100%)
- **Mathematical Calculation**: Uses formula V = (1 - 1.5·σ_ω/⟨ω⟩)^N for N=10
- **Color-Coded Status**:
  - Green: Excellent (>50%)
  - Blue: Good (10-50%)
  - Yellow: Limited (1-10%)
  - Red: Very Challenging (<1%)
- **Explanatory Text**: Describes what basin volume means

### Location:
New card in Environmental Factors section, below the temperature conversion

### User Value:
Shows the practical difficulty of achieving synchronization. A tiny basin (0.0001% for Q10=2.2) means it's nearly impossible to randomly enter the synchronized state.

---

## Enhancement #3: Synchronization Time Estimate ✅

### What Was Added:
- **Time Prediction**: Calculates expected days to reach R > 0.95
- **Current K Display**: Shows assumed coupling strength
- **Critical Kc Display**: Shows theoretical minimum coupling
- **Formula-Based**: Uses τ_sync = ln(N/ε)/λ where λ = K - K_c
- **Dynamic Updates**: Changes with Q10 and σ_T sliders

### Location:
Card next to Basin Volume predictor (grid layout)

### User Value:
Answers the critical question: "How long will it take my network to synchronize?" Values range from 7 days (ideal) to 16 days (realistic) to infinity (if K < K_c).

---

## Enhancement #4: Communication Bandwidth Calculator ✅

### What Was Added:
- **Bandwidth per Device**: Shows kbps or bps with proper units
- **Energy per Day**: Calculated as J/day with battery life estimate
- **Messages per Day**: Number of phase broadcasts needed
- **Efficiency Comparison**: Shows 50-100× advantage over NTP/PTP
- **Adaptive Calculation**: Fewer messages needed for well-compensated systems

### Calculations:
```
Bandwidth = (messages/day × bytes/message × 8 bits/byte) / 86400 sec/day
Energy = messages/day × 50 mJ/message
Battery life = 27 kJ / (energy per day)
```

### Location:
Blue-highlighted card at the bottom of the Interactive Simulation section

### User Value:
Proves the ultra-low-power claim with concrete numbers. Shows that realistic KaiABC needs only 1.5 kbps and 0.3 J/day (246-year battery life!).

---

## Enhancement #5: Q10 Scenario Comparison Table ✅

### What Was Added:
- **Complete Comparison Table**: Side-by-side view of Q10 = 1.0, 1.1, 2.2
- **All Key Metrics**:
  - σ_ω (frequency variance)
  - Heterogeneity percentage
  - Critical coupling K_c
  - Basin volume (%)
  - Sync time (days)
  - Bandwidth (kbps)
  - Energy (J/day)
  - Viability (star rating)
- **Color Coding**: Green for ideal, blue for realistic, red for uncompensated
- **Key Takeaway Box**: Explains why Q10=1.1 is the sweet spot
- **Responsive Design**: Scrollable on mobile, full-width on desktop

### Location:
New section (#comparison) between Interactive Simulation and Alternative Frameworks

### Added to Navigation:
- New menu item "Q10 Comparison" in sidebar

### User Value:
Provides a clear "executive summary" showing why temperature compensation (low Q10) is critical. The table dramatically shows that Q10=2.2 has 0.0001% basin volume vs 28% for Q10=1.1.

## Technical Implementation Details

### JavaScript Enhancements:
- Enhanced `updateEnvironmentCalculations()` function with ~80 additional lines
- Real-time calculations based on Q10 and σ_T sliders
- Color transitions and dynamic class updates
- Proper edge case handling (divide by zero, out of bounds)

### Mathematical Formulas Used:
1. **σ_ω Calculation**:
   ```
   dω/dT = -(2π/τ²) · (ln(Q10)/10)
   σ_ω = |dω/dT| · σ_T
   ```

2. **Basin Volume**:
   ```
   V_basin = (1 - α·σ_ω/⟨ω⟩)^N
   where α = 1.5, N = 10
   ```

3. **Sync Time**:
   ```
   τ_sync = ln(N/ε) / (K - K_c)
   where K = 2·K_c (assumed), ε = 0.01
   ```

4. **Bandwidth**:
   ```
   BW = (msgs/day × 10 bytes × 8) / 86400 sec
   ```

### CSS Enhancements:
- New color gradients for progress bars
- Responsive table design
- Badge styling for status indicators
- Smooth transitions (500ms)

### Accessibility:
- All new elements have proper semantic HTML
- Color coding supplemented with text labels
- Table includes column headers
- Responsive design works on mobile
