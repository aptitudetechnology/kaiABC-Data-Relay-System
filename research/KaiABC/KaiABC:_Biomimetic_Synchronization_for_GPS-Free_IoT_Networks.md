# KaiABC: Biomimetic Synchronization for GPS-Free IoT Networks

## Abstract

We present KaiABC, a biomimetic synchronization system inspired by cyanobacteria circadian rhythms, designed for GPS-free Internet of Things (IoT) networks. By implementing the KaiABC protein oscillator model on low-power microcontrollers, we achieve distributed time synchronization with 4.9% prediction accuracy over extended periods. The system features temperature compensation, adaptive synchronization, and seamless integration with the Flexible Data Relay System (FDRS) for agricultural and environmental monitoring applications. Our implementation demonstrates that biological synchronization principles can provide robust, energy-efficient alternatives to traditional GPS-based timing in resource-constrained IoT deployments.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 GPS-Free Synchronization Challenge

GPS-based time synchronization, while accurate, presents significant challenges for IoT networks:
- High power consumption from GPS modules
- Limited indoor/outdoor coverage
- Vulnerability to signal jamming and spoofing
- Dependency on external infrastructure

These limitations are particularly problematic for:
- Remote agricultural monitoring
- Underground sensor networks
- Industrial IoT in GPS-denied environments
- Battery-powered sensor nodes

### 1.2 Biological Inspiration

The KaiABC system draws inspiration from cyanobacteria circadian rhythms, specifically the KaiABC protein oscillator that maintains ~24-hour cycles without external timing cues. This biological clock:
- Operates autonomously for months
- Maintains accuracy despite temperature variations
- Uses minimal energy
- Exhibits robust synchronization properties

## 2. System Architecture

**Mathematical Model:**
$$\frac{d[KaiC_p]}{dt} = k_1[KaiA][KaiC] - k_2[KaiC_p]$$
