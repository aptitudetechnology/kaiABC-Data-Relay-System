Kakeya-N Scaling: Mathematical Derivations for Basin Volume Theory
==================================================================

PLACEHOLDER FILE: Mathematical foundations for Kakeya → Kuramoto connection
===========================================================================

This file contains placeholder functions for the mathematical derivations that are
currently MISSING from the empirical basin volume theory. While the computational
results show excellent empirical performance (4.9% error), the theoretical foundation
connecting Kakeya geometry to Kuramoto basin volumes remains conjectural.

FOUR MISSING DERIVATIONS:
========================

1. ❌ √N scaling derivation from Kakeya theory
2. ❌ Functional forms (V9.1) from geometric measure theory
3. ❌ Rigorous Kakeya ↔ Kuramoto boundary connection
4. ❌ Scaling laws from harmonic analysis first principles

These placeholders serve as:
- Roadmap for future mathematical collaboration
- Specification of what proofs are needed
- Bridge between empirical success and theoretical foundation

STATUS: Empirical conjecture requiring mathematical validation
NEXT STEP: Collaborate with harmonic analysts and geometric measure theorists
