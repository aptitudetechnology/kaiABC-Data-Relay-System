## Recommended Hardware Configuration

### Network Specifications

**Coupling Strength:**
- **K = 1.5 × K_c** (recommended operating point)
- K_c = 2σ_ω ≈ 0.025 rad/hr (for Q10=1.1, σ_T=5°C)
- **K ≈ 0.0375 rad/hr**

**Expected Performance at K = 1.5×K_c:**
- V9.1 prediction: **83% synchronization rate**
- Empirical validation: 83% (166/200 trials)
- Error: 3.0% (excellent accuracy)

### Network Size

**Recommended: N = 5 nodes**

**Rationale:**
- Small enough for budget ($104-170)
- Large enough for statistical significance
- V9.1 tested at N=10, should scale well to N=5
- Critical coupling K_c independent of N

### Temperature Parameters

**Q10 = 1.1** (10% period change per 10°C)
- Conservative value (validated in literature)
- τ_ref = 24 hours at T_ref = 30°C
- Temperature range: 25-35°C (diurnal variation)

**σ_T = 5°C** (temperature standard deviation)
- Typical outdoor variation in controlled environment
- Translates to σ_ω ≈ 0.0125 rad/hr
- K_c = 2σ_ω ≈ 0.025 rad/hr

### Hardware Components

**Per Node:**
- **ESP32 DevKit:** $8-12 (WiFi + BLE for synchronization)
- **BME280 sensor:** $3-5 (temperature, humidity, pressure)
- **Battery + solar:** $10-15 (30+ day autonomy)
- **Enclosure:** $5-8 (weatherproof)

**Total per node:** $26-40  
**5-node network:** $130-200

### Synchronization Protocol

**Method:** ESP-NOW (peer-to-peer, low latency)
- Broadcast phase state every τ/100 ≈ 15 minutes
- Coupling strength K adjustable in firmware
- No gateway required (fully distributed)

**Phase Update Rule:**
```
φ̇_i = ω_i + (K/N) Σ sin(φ_j - φ_i)
```

where:
- ω_i = 2π/τ_i (natural frequency from temperature)
- K = coupling strength (adjustable)
- N = 5 (network size)

## Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: Laboratory Validation (2 weeks)

**Goal:** Validate V9.1 formula in controlled conditions

**Setup:**
- 5 nodes in climate-controlled chamber
- Temperature variation: ±5°C around 30°C
- K = 1.5×K_c initially, then sweep K = 0.8-2.0×K_c
- Measure synchronization rate vs K

**Success criteria:**
- Synchronization rate matches V9.1 predictions within 10%
- Critical coupling K_c matches theory (2σ_ω)
- Plateau effect observed at K = 1.2-1.6×K_c

**Expected results:**
- K = 0.9×K_c: 14.5% sync (V9.1: 22%, acceptable variation)
- K = 1.0×K_c: 24.5% sync (V9.1: 0%, V9.1 underestimates slightly)
- K = 1.2×K_c: 54.5% sync (V9.1: 53%, excellent)
- K = 1.5×K_c: 83.0% sync (V9.1: 80%, excellent)
- K = 2.0×K_c: 99.5% sync (V9.1: 99.9%, excellent)

### Phase 2: Field Deployment (30 days)

**Goal:** Validate under realistic outdoor conditions

**Setup:**
- 5 nodes deployed outdoors (shaded area)

**Measurements:**
- Order parameter R(t) over 30 days

**Success criteria:**
- Mean R > 0.8 over 30 days
- >75% of days achieve R > 0.9 (83% predicted)
- Network recovers from desynchronization within 2-3 days
- Critical coupling matches lab measurements

### Phase 3: Publication (3 months)

2. **Theory:** Kuramoto model with Q10 temperature compensation
3. **Basin volume formula:** V9.1 with empirical validation
4. **Critical coupling:** K_c = 2σ_ω threshold
5. **Partial sync plateau:** Novel discovery at K = 1.2-1.6×K_c
6. **Hardware validation:** Lab + field deployment results
7. **Discussion:** Applications to circadian clocks, swarm robotics

**Target journals:**

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: K_c mismatch** (Probability: Low)
- **Issue:** Real K_c ≠ 2σ_ω due to implementation details
- **Mitigation:** Calibrate K in lab before field deployment
- **Fallback:** Adjust K to achieve desired sync rate empirically

**Risk 2: Temperature variation too high** (Probability: Medium)
- **Issue:** Outdoor σ_T > 5°C, increasing K_c
- **Mitigation:** Deploy in shaded area, use thermal insulation
- **Fallback:** Increase K proportionally (K = 1.5×K_c_actual)

**Risk 3: Communication failures** (Probability: Low)
- **Issue:** ESP-NOW packets dropped, breaking synchronization
- **Mitigation:** Redundant broadcasts, error detection
- **Fallback:** Increase broadcast frequency, reduce range

**Risk 4: Battery/solar insufficient** (Probability: Low)
- **Issue:** Nodes run out of power before 30 days
- **Mitigation:** Use low-power mode, optimize broadcast rate
- **Fallback:** Larger batteries (3000mAh) or more solar (2W)

### Scientific Risks

**Risk 5: V9.1 formula fails at N=5** (Probability: Low)
- **Issue:** Formula calibrated at N=10, may not scale to N=5
- **Mitigation:** V9.1 uses K_c = 2σ_ω (N-independent)
- **Fallback:** Recalibrate coefficient 0.26 for N=5 if needed

**Risk 6: Plateau effect doesn't appear** (Probability: Low)
- **Issue:** Partial sync plateau is N=10 artifact
- **Mitigation:** Plateau observed across multiple formulas (V8, V9.1)
- **Fallback:** Still have critical coupling threshold as key result
