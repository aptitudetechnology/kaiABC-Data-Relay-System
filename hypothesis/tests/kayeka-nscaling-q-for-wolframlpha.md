# Wolfram Alpha Queries for Improving Fractal Dimension Bounds Analysis

## Problem Statement
Current fractal dimension bounds test shows "INCONCLUSIVE" results. The box-counting dimension estimation across N=[10,20,50,100,200] oscillators doesn't reveal clear scaling patterns with system size, making it difficult to establish connections to Kakeya-inspired geometric bounds.

## Goal
Use Wolfram Alpha to derive improved mathematical methods for:
1. More accurate fractal dimension estimation
2. Better scaling law detection
3. Rigorous statistical validation
4. Alternative geometric analysis techniques
