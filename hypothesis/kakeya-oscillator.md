# KaiABC Distributed Oscillator Synchronization Hypothesis

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Project:** Biological Oscillator Networks for IoT Time Synchronization  
**Research Question:** Can temperature-compensated Kuramoto oscillators achieve distributed synchronization on low-power IoT networks, and do geometric constraints from Kakeya set theory accurately predict synchronization performance?

---

## 1. Research Hypotheses (Null and Alternate)

### **Primary Hypothesis: Synchronization Convergence**

**H₀ (Null Hypothesis):**  
A network of N=10 distributed oscillators with Kuramoto coupling strength K=0.10 rad/hr and temperature-compensated KaiABC dynamics (Q₁₀=1.1) will **NOT** achieve synchronization (order parameter R ≥ 0.90) within 30 days of operation under temperature variance σ_T = 5°C.

**H₁ (Alternate Hypothesis):**  
A network of N=10 distributed oscillators with K=0.10 rad/hr and Q₁₀=1.1 **WILL** achieve synchronization (R ≥ 0.90) within 30 days, with convergence time τ_sync = 16 ± 8 days as predicted by the formula:

```
τ_sync ≈ (1/λ)·ln(N/ε)·τ_ref
where λ = K - K_c, K_c = 2σ_ω
```

**Statistical Test:** Wilcoxon signed-rank test comparing observed sync time against predicted 16-day median.

---

### **Secondary Hypothesis 1: Critical Coupling Threshold**

**H₀:**  
The critical coupling strength K_c calculated from temperature variance using the formula K_c = 2σ_ω does **NOT** accurately predict the synchronization threshold (±50% error).

**H₁:**  
The theoretical critical coupling K_c = 2σ_ω predicts the empirical synchronization threshold within ±50% error, where:

```
σ_ω = (2π/τ_ref)·(|ln(Q₁₀)|/10)·σ_T

For Q₁₀=1.1, σ_T=5°C:
σ_ω = 0.021 rad/hr
K_c = 0.042 rad/hr
```

**Statistical Test:** Binary search for empirical K_c, compare with theoretical prediction using 95% confidence interval.

---

### **Secondary Hypothesis 2: Basin of Attraction Volume**

**H₀:**  
The basin of attraction for synchronized states does **NOT** follow the predicted volume formula:

```
V_basin/V_total ≈ (1 - 1.5·σ_ω/⟨ω⟩)^N
```

**H₁:**  
Monte Carlo simulations with random initial conditions will show that 25-35% of trials converge to synchronization when K = 2K_c, matching the predicted basin volume of 28% for N=10, Q₁₀=1.1.

**Statistical Test:** Chi-square goodness-of-fit test comparing observed convergence rate (100 trials) against predicted 28% basin volume.

---

### **Secondary Hypothesis 3: Temperature Compensation (Q₁₀ Measurement)**

**H₀:**  
The software KaiABC implementation does **NOT** exhibit temperature compensation with Q₁₀ ≈ 1.1 (|measured Q₁₀ - 1.1| > 0.3).

**H₁:**  
Measured oscillator period at three temperatures (15°C, 25°C, 35°C) will yield Q₁₀ = 1.1 ± 0.3, confirming temperature compensation matching biological KaiABC proteins.

**Statistical Test:** Linear regression on log(τ) vs. 1/T, extract Q₁₀ from slope, compare with 95% CI [0.8, 1.4].

---

### **Secondary Hypothesis 4: Power Consumption**

**H₀:**  
Real-world power consumption of LoRaWAN nodes does **NOT** match theoretical predictions within a factor of 3 (measured > 1.65 J/day).

**H₁:**  
Measured average power consumption will be 0.55 ± 0.40 J/day per node (LoRaWAN with 6 msg/day), within 3× of theoretical prediction accounting for real-world inefficiencies.

**Statistical Test:** Paired t-test comparing measured vs. predicted energy consumption over 7-day deployment.
