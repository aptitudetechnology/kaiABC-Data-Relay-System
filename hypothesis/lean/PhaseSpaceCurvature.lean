# Phase Space Curvature Hypothesis

This file formalizes the phase space curvature hypothesis for Kuramoto basin scaling.
The key finding: curvature κ(N) ~ N^(-0.477) with R² = 0.983, explaining V ~ exp(-√N).

Note: This is a conceptual formalization focusing on the logical structure.
Full mathematical implementation would require Mathlib extensions.
